[*SparkFun Raspberry Pi 400 Qwiic pHAT Extension (DEV-17512)*](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/17512)

The SparkFun Qwiic pHAT Extension for the Raspberry Pi 400 provides you with a quick and easy solution to access all of the 400's GPIO, stack your favorite HAT right-side up, or connect a Qwiic-enabled device to the I<sup>2</sup>C bus (GND, 3.3V, SDA, and SCL). Since the Qwiic system allows for daisy-chaining boards with different addresses, you can also stack as many sensors as youâ€™d like to the mounting holes on the pHAT to create a tower of sensing power! 

The Qwiic pHAT Extension connects to the Raspberry Pi 400's GPIO using a 2x20 right angle header and extends out to the edge of the PCB. Two Qwiic connectors are included on each side of the board for easy access to the I<sup>2</sup>C bus. A set of large silicone bumpers have also been included for better stability when connecting the Qwiic pHAT Extension to the Raspberry Pi 400's GPIO port.
